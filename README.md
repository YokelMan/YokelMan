- 👋 Hello there! I'm YokelMan, a 15-year-old coder not knowing how to use GitHub.
- 👀 I’m interested in programs like Java and Python  (they're the only two I kinda know).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much for now, cause I literally don't know anything about Git.
- 📫 Reach me by my discord (わたし#0002).
